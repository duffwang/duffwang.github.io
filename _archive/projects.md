## Discovering Trends in Home Loans 

I used a publically available dataset to analyse home loan trends from the year 2012-2014. The goal of this analysis is simply to explore the data and see what conclusions we can draw. It is intended to demonstrate the versatility and clarity of R Markdown and Shiny in presenting analysis through dynamic figures and tools.

Note: Because it is an interactive report using a large dataset, it may take a minute or so to load.
