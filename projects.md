## Home Loans 

I used a publically available dataset to analyse home loan trends from the year 2012-2014. The goal of this analysis is simply to explore the data and see what conclusions we can draw, as well as demonstrate the versatility of R Markdown in presenting data visualiation through dynamic figures and tools. <p>

<p>Note: Because it is an interactive report, it will take a minute or so to load all the data.
