title: Building an Interactive Data Visualization Tool using Shiny 
---


##Introduction

Shiny is an open source R package used for building web applications. It's a powerful tool that can create interactive GUIs for exploring, modifying, and visualizing data. Graphs and output can respond dynamically to user inputs in real time.

To demonstrate Shiny, I've created an interactive tool based on the Home Loan dataset I have been using in the previous few posts. I've hosted the tool on shinyapps.io, a convenient Shiny deployment site created by RStudio.
